            <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>
                Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system
                resources. especially data storage(cloud storage) and computing
                power, without direct active managemet by the user. The term is
                generally used to describe data centers available to may users
                over the internet. it is the delivery of computing services
                incliding servers, storage, database, networking, software
                analytics, and intelligence over the internet("the cloud") to
                offer faster innovation flexible resources, and economies of
                scale. it is a popular opinion for people and businesses for a
                neumber of reaons including cost savings, increased
                productivity, speed and efficiency, peformance and security.
            </p>

                in order to adress the storage demand, companies like amaxon,
                microsoft, google etc. are providing very large server farms and
                data centers over the internet to thousands of users who play
                only for the resource they use. because organizations using
                public cloud does not won the infastructies they do not ahve to
                make huge investments in their own hardware and softwares.
                public clouds are ideal for small and medium sized buisnesses
                who can't afford to fully devlop their own infastructure; for
                application requiring high peformance, scalability and
                availability. such model of computing in virtuaized resources is
                called cloud computing. companies offering these computing
                services are called cloud providers and typically charge for
                cloud computing services based on usage, simmilar to how we
                paued boll for water , electricit, telephone at home some of the
                cloud providers are amazon AWS, microsoft azure, google cloud,
                IBM cloud, VMware Cloud, oracle could and alibaba cloud. <br>
                use of cloud computing:
                <ul>
                    <li>store, backup and recover data</li>
                    <li>host website and blogs</li>
                    <li>create new apps and services</li>
                    <li>stream audio and video</li>
                    <li>deliver software on demand</li>
                </ul>
