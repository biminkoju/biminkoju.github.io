                Intranet is an intenrt-based technology within an organization
                to facilitate communication and access to information. It is a
                set of networks,using the internet protocol and IP-based tools
                such as webbrowsers and file transfer application, which is
                under the control of a single administrative entity. that
                administrative entity closes the Intranet to all but specific,
                authorized users. Most commonly an intranet is hte internal
                network of an organization. A large intranet will typically have
                least one web server to provide users with organizational
                information./p>

            <h2>Extranet</h2>
            <p>
                An extranet is simmilar to an internet but it is made accessible
                to selected external partners such as buisness partners,
                suppliers, key customers, etc. for exchanging data and
                applications and sharing information. As with an intranet, an
                extranet can also provide remote acess to coporate systems for
                staff that spends lots of time out of the office, for instance
                those in sales or customer support, or home workers.
