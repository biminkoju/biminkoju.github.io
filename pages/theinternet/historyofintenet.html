            <h1>History of internet</h1>
            <p>
                In 1969, the department of defense(DoD) of the united states of
                america started a project to allow researchers and millitary
                personnel to communicate with eahother in an emergency. The
                project was called derence advanced research project and the
                institution was defense advanced research prject agency(DARPA).
                <br />
                Therefore,internet at that time was called DARPAnet. It began in
                a modest way with one computer in california and three in utah.
                Later to share the software and hardware resources, the
                millitary allowerd universities to join the network. From where
                the students caught up with it and devloped much of the
                software, giving birth to the now so very popular interent.
                <br />
                In 1992, US vise president AL gore declared that internet would
                be avialable to all in the world
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the 1970's, what would later become the internet was
                devloped. while mostly millirary personnel and scientists used
                it in its early days, the advent of the world wide web int he
                early 1990's changed all that. <br />
                Today. the internet is not owned or operated by any one entity.
                This worldwide computer network allows people to communicate and
                exchange information in new ways. no one actually owns the
                internet, and no singel person or organixation controls the
                internet in its entirety. <br />
                The internet s more of a concept that an actual tangible entit,
                and it relies on a physical infastructure that connects networks
                to other networks
